One common use of bash is for releasing a build of source code.  Sometimes there is private source code that contains info that the developers do not want to release/publish.

This project creates a release script to copy certain files from a source directory into a build directory.

For this project you will need to create an empty build folder to transfer the source files to that build folder.
